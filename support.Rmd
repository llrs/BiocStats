# Introduction

Here we are going to analyse the usage of the support site of Bioconductor and its relationship with the packages. See the home of the analysis [here](index.html).

We will use the api of the [site](https://support.bioconductor.org/info/api/).

# First post


```{r api0}
base <- "https://support.bioconductor.org/api/"
post0 <- fromJSON(paste0(base, "stats/day/0"))
post0$date
post0$type
```
Here we can see that the first post in bioconductor is from 2001, but it must be from the mailing list because it doesn't have a type description.

# First day 

The first day of the support site was 16/09/2014 as you can see [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rbioc-sig-proteomics/3Bmnzx5nsak)
```{r firstDay}
post1 <- fromJSON(paste0(base, "stats/date/2014/09/16"))
(original_posts <- sum(post1$answers, post1$comments, post1$questions))
```


# Today
```{r today}

```
